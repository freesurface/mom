## MOM, WOW US!

Keeping track of how you spend your time is essential to consultants and many
professional industries. It's the data you use to bill your clients, and thus
earn your living. There are a plethora of tools available today to accomplish
this goal, but they all seem to fall short. Often they are arms of monolithic
business systems built deep within the bowels of software shops, away from real
human feedback. Or they expect you to notify them of when you start and stop a
job. The problem is that we are all busy and sometimes being cognisant of when
we are working on what is really hard. In the end we end up fudging the data,
it's only human. This is problematic because it prevents us from estimating and
forecasting with real information, everything becomes a guess.
