Matters of Minutes
==================

A time tool designed to keep track of you just like a mom.

## Philosophy

The goal is to create an application that is completely Decentralized. 
Seperating all our concerns creates an application that
can grow well in the open source community. By using tools that can help us enforce this practice we hope to get a 
better understanding on creating apps that are very clear and readable by someone looking to contribute.



## Tools Being Used

While always keeping our design philosophy in mind, we are going to use tools that help us build a scalable and 
decentralized application.

### BackboneJS

Backbone is being used because of the control it gives us in how we want to create the app. 
It gives us all the tools we need in order to create a scalable application. 
Backbone also gives us access to a large community to help us achieve our goals.

## The Plan

## Activities & Checkups

Activities are going to be the tasks that the user inputs into the app. The application will then *checkup* 
with the user using push notifications. This has to be designed in such a way that is completely modular and decentralized. Since this app is going to be designed in such a way it can 
grow naturally and clearly, the activities need to be stored in a way that gives the app the ability to be synched 
across multiple devices and servers. They also need to be designed so the app can resume easily from where it left off
previously.
