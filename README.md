Matters of Minutes
==================

A time tracking tool designed to keep track of you just like a mom.

## Philosophy

The goal is to create an application that is completely Decentralized. Seperating all our concerns creates an application that
can grow well in the open source community. By using tools that can help us enforce this practice we hope to get a 
better understanding on creating apps that are very clear and readable by someone looking to contribute.



## Tools Being Used

### BackboneJS

Backbone is being used because of the control it gives us in how we want to create the app. It gives us all the tools we need
in order to create a scalable application. Backbone also gives us access to a large community to help us achieve our goals.

## The Plan

## Activities & Checkups

Each activity and checkup will be its own object as well as interact with each other. 
These interactions will mirror in the local storage db as well as the backbone models.

#### Activity Registry

#### Checkup Registry
