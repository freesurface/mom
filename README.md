#### It's important to know how we spend our time

Keeping track of how time is spent is essential to consultants and many
professional industries. It's the data used to bill clients, and thus make
money.

There are a plethora of tools available today which strive to accomplish this
goal, but they all seem to fall short. Some are very basic and act as little
more than an exagerated spreadsheet and others claim to be revolutionary
concepts that will bring us new found productivity. The problem is that they
all expect us to adapt to them, and frankly we just don't have the time or
patience.

MOM aims to have one single goal, which is to find out how you spend your time.
You should not have to learn how to use the tool, it should cater to your
instinctive impulses. It should go out of it's way to learn how you think so
that it can make sure that you are on point. It should think like your mom.

#### MOM is designed to evolve

All too often software is built deep within the bowels of software shops, away
from real human feedback. When it is exposed to feedback it is often from small
pockets of culture that tend to be disaccociated from how real people think,
often making obscure assumptions about an ideal world.

MOM is being built as 100% open-source and right out in the open. The project
welcomes discussion from anyone and we promise to engage with you. We don't
promise to bend to your will, but we certainly aim to understand where you are
coming from. Understanding what people are trying to do with software is
quinessential to getting it right. It makes no sense to build something that
people must adapt to. Period.

From the beginning MOM has been designed to be flexible in its technical
approach. MOM aims to push the boundaries of how operational software is built.
We believe that if done right, progress can be uninhibited and natural. If it
makes people's lives easier, people will make it better... for free. The
problem at hand affects developers, designers and great thinkers alike.
