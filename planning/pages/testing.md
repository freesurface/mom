Testing with AngularJS
---------------------------


Unit testing is a technique that helps developers validate isolated pieces of code. 
End to end testing (E2E) comes into play when you want to ascertain that a set of components, when integrated together, 
work as expected. AngularJS, being a modern JavaScript MVC framework, offers full support for unit tests and E2E tests. 
Writing tests while developing Angular apps can save a great deal of time which you would have otherwise wasted fixing unexpected bugs. 
we will use Jasmine as the testing framework and Karma as the test runner.
