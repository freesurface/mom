Deploying testing apps
================================

We are going to deploy our apps to multiple platforms for testin purposes.
This will give us a good feel on how the app interacts and functions on different devices.

The app currently uses Karma as a Test Runner for unit tests and Travis CI for continual integration.
With the karma server running, every time a change is made to a watched file, the test are run
